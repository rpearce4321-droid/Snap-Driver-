# Version Two (Shelved)

## Badge Trust Trend Concept

Status: shelved. We removed all trend visuals from the UI for now.

### Goal
Show trust movement at a glance:
- where the trust score is now
- where it was in the last check
- where it could land on the next verification

### Notes from the attempt
- Line/graph approaches felt noisy and hard to read.
- The idea shifted toward a single horizontal track with clear markers.
- Markers should be color-coded: previous (neutral), current (primary), projected next (accent).

### Potential v2 direction
- A clean, horizontal trust track with three markers and minimal labels.
- Optional tooltip or small legend for Previous / Now / Next.
- Keep it consistent across seeker and retainer views.
